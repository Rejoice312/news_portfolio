            <p>
                In a significant move aimed at improving child nutrition, boosting school enrollment,
                and enhancing learning outcomes, the Rivers State Government has officially expanded
                its robust school feeding program to include public primary schools in Ahoada East
                Local Government Area. This initiative, which provides free, nutritious meals to pupils
                during school hours, is part of a broader commitment to ensuring that no child is left
                behind in the pursuit of quality education, especially those from vulnerable backgrounds.
            </p>

            <p>
                The program's expansion into Ahoada East comes after successful implementation in
                several other LGAs, where it has demonstrably led to increased attendance rates and
                improved concentration among students. By providing a daily meal, the state government
                is directly addressing a fundamental barrier to education, allowing pupils to focus on
                their studies without the distraction of hunger. The meals are carefully planned to be
                balanced and locally sourced, supporting local farmers and economies.
            </p>

            <p>
                Speaking during the launch ceremony, the Commissioner for Primary Education, Dr. Helen
                Davies, emphasized the long-term benefits of the initiative. She described the program
                as an investment in children’s health, future, and the overall development of Rivers State.
            </p>

            <p>
                Parents and guardians in Ahoada East have welcomed the initiative with relief, noting
                that the program eases financial burdens while encouraging consistent school attendance.
                Teachers have also reported improved energy levels, participation, and attentiveness
                among pupils since the commencement of the feeding program.
            </p>

            <p>
                Community leaders have commended the government’s foresight, describing the initiative
                as a critical step toward tackling child malnutrition and strengthening foundational
                education. Local monitoring committees have been established to ensure transparency,
                quality, and sustainability of the program.
            </p>

            <p>
                With the successful rollout in Ahoada East, the Rivers State Government reaffirmed its
                commitment to expanding the school feeding program across more communities, reinforcing
                education as a cornerstone for social and economic development.
