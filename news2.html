            <p>
                In a strategic effort to elevate the standard of teaching and learning across public
                schools, the Rivers State Ministry of Education has commenced a comprehensive
                professional development and welfare program for teachers in Ikwerre Local Government Area.
                The initiative is designed to equip educators with modern teaching methodologies,
                digital skills, and updated curriculum knowledge.
            </p>

            <p>
                The program features a series of workshops, seminars, and hands-on sessions facilitated
                by experienced education consultants and university lecturers. Core focus areas include
                learner-centered teaching strategies, classroom management, digital literacy, and
                effective assessment techniques. The training also addresses teacher welfare, highlighting
                motivation, stress management, and professional growth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Speaking at the opening ceremony in Isiokpo, the Commissioner for Education,
                Professor Ngozi Okoro, emphasized the importance of continuous teacher development.
                She noted that well-equipped and motivated teachers are essential for producing
                students who can think critically and compete academically.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many teachers welcomed the initiative, describing it as timely and impactful.
                Participants expressed enthusiasm about incorporating technology into their lessons
                and adopting more engaging teaching approaches that enhance student understanding.
            </p>

            <p>
                The program also promotes collaboration among teachers, creating a platform for
                sharing best practices and addressing common challenges in the classroom.
                Students are expected to benefit from more dynamic, interactive, and effective teaching methods.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond training, the Ministry of Education announced plans to review teacher incentives,
                improve working conditions, and provide clearer career advancement pathways.
                This holistic approach aims to attract and retain skilled educators across Rivers State.
