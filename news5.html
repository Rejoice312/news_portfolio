            <p>
                Students in public secondary schools across Oyigbo Local Government Area of Rivers State
                are set to experience a new phase of academic advancement following the commissioning
                of newly renovated and fully equipped modern libraries and science laboratories in selected schools.
                The initiative aims to strengthen learning outcomes by improving access to quality educational resources.
            </p>

            <p>
                The facilities feature up-to-date textbooks, reference materials, digital learning tools,
                and comfortable reading spaces. The newly installed science laboratories are equipped
                with modern apparatus for physics, chemistry, and biology practicals, addressing long-standing
                infrastructure challenges in public schools within the area.
            </p>

            <p>
                Speaking during the unveiling ceremony at Government Secondary School, Oyigbo,
                the Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Engr. David Enyinda, reaffirmed
                the state government’s commitment to providing a conducive environment for learning
                and scientific exploration. He described the facilities as gateways to innovation and discovery.
            </p>

            <p>
                Teachers and school administrators expressed optimism that the upgraded facilities
                would significantly enhance students’ academic performance and practical understanding.
                The availability of functional laboratories is expected to improve outcomes in science-related subjects
                and better prepare students for external examinations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Students also welcomed the development, noting that hands-on experiments would
                make learning more engaging and meaningful. Parents commended the government
                for investing in infrastructure that supports long-term educational growth.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Rivers State Government urged school authorities and community leaders
                to ensure proper maintenance and security of the facilities.
                Plans are underway to extend similar projects to other local government areas
                as part of a broader education reform strategy.
